\addchap{Abstract}
Due to the high speed and innovation regarding frontend web development, applications receive the legacy state just a few months after the start of development.
One of the biggest issues is to keep all required tools up-to-date and running.
Often the tools are backwards-incompatible or have serious problems regarding versioning, putting you into trouble sooner than later.

As part of the analysis of the current state of frontend development a comprehensive list of the currently used tools is given, as well as a plausible reason for this problem is presented.
Before approaching the implementation details of the softaware/webdev-container the advantages and disadvantages of container-based development tools are listed.
In addition to the implementation details of the container, possible use cases, as well as the initial motivation for the its development and its particularities and problems get explained.
